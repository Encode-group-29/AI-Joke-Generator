# Weekend Project: AI Joke Generator

This project is a web application built using Next.js that allows users to generate jokes using AI. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can customize various parameters to generate jokes tailored to their preferences.

## Features

- **Joke Parameter Customization**: Users can specify different parameters to control the type of joke they want to generate. This includes selecting the topic (e.g., work, people, animals, food, television), tone (e.g., witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy), joke format (e.g., pun, knock-knock, story), and the level of randomness or fun to be added to the joke.

- **Joke Generation**: After configuring the desired parameters, users can click a button to generate a joke based on their selections. The generated joke will be displayed on the same page for the user to enjoy.

- **Joke Evaluation**: The application incorporates an AI-powered evaluation feature that analyzes the generated jokes and provides feedback on various criteria, such as funniness, appropriateness, offensiveness, and other important factors.

- **Local Text Generation**: The project utilizes the Text Generation WebUI application, which is run locally to serve the text generation tasks for the AI Joke Generator application.
